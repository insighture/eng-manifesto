# Engineering Manifesto 

## Innovation, Community, Efficiency: This is Insighture! 

## Principles of Engineering Excellence

At Insighture, we embrace a forward-thinking engineering approach that drives our commitment to innovation, scalability, and delivering exceptional solutions. The following principles serve as our engineering manifesto's foundation:

1. **12-Factor App:** We adhere to the 12-factor app methodology, emphasising principles such as declarative configurations, scalable processes, and stateless services. By following these best practices, we ensure our applications are portable, scalable, and resilient, enabling seamless deployment and management.

2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** We emphasise the importance of code reusability and maintainability. By following the DRY principle, we minimise duplication, reduce complexity, and enhance productivity, ensuring our codebase remains clean, efficient, and easy to manage.

3. **CAP Theorem:** We understand the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Our engineering decisions on distributed systems consider the specific requirements of each system, ensuring the appropriate balance is struck to meet business objectives and user expectations.

4. **Reactive Manifesto:** We champion the principles of responsiveness, elasticity, resilience, and message-driven communication. Our systems are designed to be reactive, ensuring they can handle varying workloads, maintain high availability, and deliver optimal performance.

5. **Evolutionary Architecture over Big Upfront Design (BUFD):** A heated topic in the engineering space. We believe in the power of evolutionary architecture, where systems evolve and adapt iteratively. Instead of investing significant time in upfront design, we prioritise incremental improvements and flexibility to embrace changing business needs and emerging technologies. The trade-offs of either extreme are associated with the cost of architectural changes in the long-run. Getting granular about columns in a database table wonâ€™t necessarily help us build robust solutions that matter.

6. **The Six Modern Principles of Modern Data Architecture:** Our data architecture principles revolve around scalability, reliability, security, ease of use, flexibility, and cost optimisation. We apply these principles to design data pipelines, storage systems, and analytics solutions that empower our clients to leverage the full potential of their data.

7. **Clean Code:** We prioritise clean code principles. We take pride in our work and have implemented the necessary controls to minimise any slip-ups on our end. By adhering to clean code practises, we ensure maintainable, readable, and high-quality code that leads to better outcomes for our clients.

8. **Modular Development:**  We promote modular development practises to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and overall efficiency. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, self-contained modules, we minimise duplication, reduce complexity, and improve productivity. Modular development ensures a clean and efficient codebase that is easier to manage and maintain over time.

9. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Our emphasis on comprehensive documentation enables effective utilisation of our systems, processes, and products. User manuals, installation guides, API references, and system architecture diagrams ensure clear communication for efficient implementation, operation, and maintenance. This promotes knowledge transfer, reduces reliance on individual expertise, and contributes to project success.

10. **Agile Principles:** We embrace agile methodologies, valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. We deliver valuable software incrementally using a Scrumban approach, a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban methodologies, wherein our client-based projects mostly use Kanban and internal product engineering occurs in Scrum style.

11. **Collaboration and Communication:** We foster a culture of open communication and collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and users. Effective communication is the foundation of successful software development. Our leads promote neurodiversity and a 'no discrimination' policy in software development because we have continuously seen how this contributes to more innovative solutions and a richer culture within the teams.

12. **Ethical Considerations:** We prioritise data privacy, terms, security, and accessibility while avoiding harm and promoting inclusivity. Our selective approach to choosing clients based on social responsibility showcases a commitment to ethical values and making a positive impact in the world. Further, we understand that there is a heavier context to a business problem and always consider the commercial impact of any solution we propose.

13. **Compliance, Regulatory, and Security Frameworks:** We place the utmost importance on compliance and security in the ever-evolving digital landscape. We remain vigilant and up-to-date with the latest industry standards, regulatory requirements, and security frameworks. By seamlessly integrating these guidelines into our engineering practises, we guarantee that our solutions adhere to the required compliance standards and establish a secure environment for safeguarding data protection and privacy. Secure coding practices at the development level instead of deployment allows us to deliver secure solutions from day one as we do not wait to validate security and compliance until the deployment comes in.

14. **Customer Data Security:** One of our highest priorities is customer data security. We design our solutions with security and data privacy at the forefront of our engineering decisions. We recognise the importance of securing sensitive data, and we take all necessary measures to ensure our customers' information is protected at all times. Our team works tirelessly to implement best practices and industry standards to guarantee the highest level of security across our products and services. We remain vigilant in our efforts to stay up-to-date with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities to deliver secure solutions from day one. At Insighture, we are committed to providing our customers with a safe and secure environment for their data.

## Engineering Best Practices

At Insighture, we strive to be at the forefront of engineering practices, constantly seeking new ways to enhance our solutions and deliver exceptional outcomes. Our manifesto extends to the following innovative practices:

1. **AWS Well-Architected Framework and Azure Well-Architected Framework:** We leverage the industry-leading best practices provided by AWS Well-Architected Framework and Microsoft Well-Architected Framework. These frameworks guide our architecture design and implementation, enabling us to build secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective solutions on cloud platforms.

2. **Champions of Refactoring for Modernization:** We are advocates of refactoring as a means to modernise systems. We use the best tools, techniques, and practises available to ensure that refactoring efforts result in improved long-term outcomes, minimising technical debt and future challenges.

3. **Event Driven / Event Sourced / Distributed Architecture:** We have a deep understanding of distributed computing at its core. We are passionate about event sourcing and event-driven architectures. Through collaborative efforts, we work with clients to unlock the potential of their platforms while keeping the running costs to a minimum.

4. **Automation:** We promote automation in all aspects of our work. We empower our engineers to automate tasks to the extent that they render themselves redundant on client projects. Our philosophy is that if it's not for us, then it's for someone else. We believe automation drives efficiency, reliability, scalability, and Security. We always think about automating recurring and repetitive tasks to let our employees focus on their innovative approaches.

5. **Data-Driven Technology Selection**: We have a strong commitment to data-driven technology selection. We believe that by utilising data analysis and insights, we can confidently make engineering decisions that deliver optimal outcomes for our clients. Our team continuously monitors and analyses data to identify areas for improvement, and we use this information to tailor our technology selections to the specific requirements of each project. This ensures that we always choose the right technology stack for each implementation, resulting in solutions that are not only scalable, reliable, and cost-effective but also meet both business objectives and user expectations.

6. **DORA and SPACE Frameworks for Developer Productivity**: Insighture actively leverages the DORA and SPACE frameworks to continually improve its software delivery and development practices. By utilising these frameworks, we are able to assess our software delivery performance, identify areas for improvement in our development processes and capabilities, and ensure that we are delivering high-quality, efficient, and reliable outcomes for our clients.

With our engineering manifesto as our guiding compass, we strive to deliver cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of innovation, scalability, and reliability. We embrace emerging technologies, leverage industry best practices, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
