# Engineering Manifesto 

## Innovation, Community, Efficiency: This is Insighture! 

## Principles of Engineering Excellence

At Insighture, we embrace a forward-thinking engineering approach that drives our commitment to innovation, scalability, and delivering exceptional solutions. Our engineering manifesto is guided by the following principles:

1. **12-Factor App:** We adhere to the 12-factor app methodology, emphasizing principles such as declarative configurations, scalable processes, and stateless services. By following these best practices, we ensure our applications are portable, scalable, and resilient, enabling seamless deployment and management.

2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** We emphasize the importance of code reusability and maintainability. By following the DRY principle, we minimize duplication, reduce complexity, and enhance productivity, ensuring our codebase remains clean, efficient, and easy to manage.

3. **CAP Theorem:** We understand the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Our engineering decisions on distributed systems consider the specific requirements of each system, ensuring the appropriate balance is struck to meet business objectives and user expectations.

4. **Reactive Manifesto:** We champion the principles of responsiveness, elasticity, resilience, and message-driven communication. Our systems are designed to be reactive, ensuring they can handle varying workloads, maintain high availability, and deliver optimal performance.

5. **Evolutionary Architecture over Big Upfront Design (BUFD):** We believe in the power of evolutionary architecture, where systems evolve and adapt iteratively. Instead of investing significant time in upfront design, we prioritize incremental improvements and flexibility to embrace changing business needs and emerging technologies.

6. **The Six Modern Principles of Modern Data Architecture:** Our data architecture principles revolve around scalability, reliability, security, ease of use, flexibility, and cost optimization. We apply these principles to design data pipelines, storage systems, and analytics solutions that empower our clients to leverage the full potential of their data.

7. **Clean Code:** We prioritize clean code principles. We take pride in our work and have implemented necessary controls to minimize any slip-ups on our end. By adhering to clean code practices, we ensure maintainable, readable, and high-quality code that leads to better outcomes for our clients.

8. **Modular Development:**  We promote modular development practices to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and overall efficiency. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, self-contained modules, we minimize duplication, reduce complexity, and improve productivity. Modular development ensures a clean and efficient codebase that is easier to manage and maintain over time.

9. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Our emphasis on comprehensive documentation enables effective utilization of our systems, processes, and products. User manuals, installation guides, API references, and system architecture diagrams ensure clear communication for efficient implementation, operation, and maintenance. This promotes knowledge transfer, reduces reliance on individual expertise, and contributes to project success.

10. **Agile Principles:** We embrace agile methodologies, valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. We deliver valuable software incrementally and iteratively.

11. **Collaboration and Communication:** We foster a culture of open communication and collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and users. Effective communication is the foundation of successful software development.

12. **Ethical Considerations:** We recognize the impact of our work on society, and we commit to ethical software development practices. We prioritize data privacy, terms, security, and accessibility while avoiding harm and promoting inclusivity.

## Engineering Best Practices

At Insighture, we strive to be at the forefront of engineering practices, constantly seeking new ways to enhance our solutions and deliver exceptional outcomes. Our manifesto extends to the following innovative practices:

1. **AWS Well-Architected Framework and Microsoft Well-Architected Framework:** We leverage the industry-leading best practices provided by AWS Well-Architected Framework and Microsoft Well-Architected Framework. These frameworks guide our architecture design and implementation, enabling us to build secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective solutions on cloud platforms.

2. **Champions of Refactoring for Modernizations:** We are advocates of refactoring as a means to modernize systems. We use the best tools, techniques, and practices available to ensure that refactoring efforts result in improved long-term outcomes, minimizing technical debt and future challenges.

3. **Event Driven / Event Sourced / Distributed Architecture:** We have a deep understanding of distributed computing at its core. We are passionate about event sourcing and event-driven architectures. Through collaborative efforts, we work with clients to unlock the potential of their platforms while keeping the running costs to a minimum.

4. **Automation:** We promote automation in all aspects of our work. We empower our engineers to automate tasks to the extent that they render themselves redundant in client projects. Our philosophy is that if not for us, then it's for someone else. We believe automation drives efficiency, reliability, and scalability.

5. **Compliance, Regulatory, and Security Frameworks**: We place utmost importance on compliance and security in the ever-evolving digital landscape. We remain vigilant and up to date with the latest industry standards, regulatory requirements, and security frameworks. By seamlessly integrating these guidelines into our engineering practices, we guarantee that our solutions adhere to the required compliance standards and establish a secure environment for safeguarding data protection and privacy.

With our engineering manifesto as our guiding compass, we strive to deliver cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of innovation, scalability, and reliability. We embrace emerging technologies, leverage industry best practices, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

At Insighture, we are passionate about engineering excellence and are committed to building a future where technology empowers businesses
